This is a vendored copy of the fmt library, v6.2.0.

See https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt for more info.

The procedure for updating:
1. Download the release zip from github
2. Unzip it somewhere
3. Copy headers: `cp include/fmt/* c10/fmt/`
4. Copy sources: `cp src/* c10/fmt/`
5. Fix up sources to correctly use the flattened structure
   (e.g. `#include "fmt/os.h"` becomes `#include "os.h"`)
